React component theming with Emotion https://emotion.sh

Is possible to combine traditional SASS framework and dynamic custom React component styling?

Yes, it is. Here we go: Bootstrap + Emotion

Please feel free to clone this repo, do "npm install", "npm run build", and run "node-http-server" or any other http server to test it locally.
