# Hello-Paris

Minimalistic React project. Component theming with Emotion https://emotion.sh

Is it possible to combine traditional SASS framework and dynamic custom React component styling?

Sure, it is. Here we go: *React + Bootstrap + Emotion*

Demo: http://donsro.atwebpages.com/projects/emotion-theming/public/

Feel free to clone this repo, do *npm install*, *npm run build*, and run *node-http-server* or any other *http* server to test it locally.
